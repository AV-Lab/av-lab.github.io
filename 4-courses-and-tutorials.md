## Courses
# ROBO 201 Motion Planning Algorithms for Robotics
This course provides knowledge on path planning algorithms for autonomous robot navigation within the context of the Robotics Operating System (ROS). Students explore examples relevant to both mobile and manipulator robots. The course covers the representation of robot environment using configuration space, the construction of occupancy grid maps of obstacles, and the utilization of these maps for path planning.

## Tutorials and Projects

# Smart Scheduling | Summer Project 2025
This summer project is designed for a group of undergraduate students: Osama Qadan, Mohammed Shmiul Islam, Omar Mehsen Omar Mohamed, and Abd Alrahman Basim Ismaik. The goal is to develop an automatic course scheduling system that provides recommendations and suggestions to students based on their preferences and completed courses. The system considers factors such as course prerequisites, student workload, and available time slots to generate optimal schedules. By simplifying the course selection process, the project aims to help students efficiently manage their time and fulfill degree requirements, ultimately enhancing their academic experience.

[July 13 - July 22]

This high-level course teaches the basics of system integration using Linux OS and Robot Operating System (ROS). The objective is to build technical maturity and problem-solving skills to deal with diverse software efficiently and in a timely manner to get the task done. The course targets audiences from computer science (CS) backgrounds as well as those from other engineering disciplines as long as they are curious to learn beyond the instructions provided. For CS majors, the course will be more like a revision of basics but at the same time integrates different approaches that the student might not have been exposed to together.
