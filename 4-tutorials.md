### Day 7-8: Cloud Robotics
_Designed by Majid Khonji, Supervised by Arjun Sharma_

The objective here is to learn how to integrate one or more robots with a custom cloud server so that you can achieve some collaborative functionalities. We will try to perform those tasks using standard Linux tools without resorting fancy custom-made software. The knowledge you gain in this section will be highly transferrable to other domains as well outside robotics.

**Project: RESTful Robot - A Remote Tracking System**
<p style="color:red; font-weight:bold"> Deadline: 29/7/2022 </p>

The objective of this exercise is to build a small system that tracks your robots in the cloud. Due to limited time, we will build a simplified system using Turtlebot simulation, but the concept can scale and be applied to any robotic platform. Remember, a robot is simply a computer with sensors and actuators, so you might have a microcontroller (Arduino) connected with a temperature sensor and servo motor and connected to a PC via a serial connection, USB. That is a robot. Increase the number of motors to four, connect a LiDAR and a webcam to the PC, and you get a car capable of autonomous driving. 
In this project, we have two parts:
- Cloud server: collects telemetry information from one or more robots
- Robot(s): runs on your laptop. We have a ROS node that sends POST requests to the server every second to update its location. We will run a simulated robot, but in principle, the same exact code would also run on real robots.


<u>More precisely, you should perform the following tasks:</u>
- Run a Turtlesim simulation. Execute turtlesim_node and  turtle_teleop_key (but you may try more sophisticated simulations as well).
- Remote server connection: Write a ROS node that reads the x and y coordinates of the robot and sends HTTP POST requests to your cloud. Please use three variables in your code to allow easy configuration, `robot_name`, `server_address`, and `api_freq`  where `api_delay` decides how much delay between subsequent API calls; set it to 1 sec.
- RESTful  API: your cloud server should follow the structure below
    -  POST: accept a request following  `<server_address>/robot_name/x/y`, where `<robot_name>` is the name that you chose for your ROS node, and x and y are Turtle coordinates. You may implement a python code (or bash script or any language you like) that receives the query from CGI module and append the received coordinates to a file named `<robot_name>_loc.csv`. You can choose any format for the file, but I suggest something like `yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss, x, x` for each line.
    -  GET: `<server_address>/<robot_name>` returns a simple HTML that shows a PNG plot for robot location. You may implement it in python and use [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) to output a PNG plot. You need [`plt.plot`](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.plot.html) and `plt.savefig(<robot_name>.png)`
- Test your code with 2-3 of your colleagues and check if your RESTful API is functional
- Optional: 
    - Create an additional API that shows all robot locations: a GET API `<server_address>/All`.
    - Try to show a [live plot using Javascript](https://canvasjs.com/html5-javascript-dynamic-chart/). 

**Submission Instruction**:
- Send an Email to `arjun.sharma at ku.ac.ae`, and CC `majid.khonji at ku.ac.ae`,  titled:
    - `[AV-lab mini-project]: <first_name>_<last_name>`
- In the email, provide the following:
    - Your `<server_address>`. Make sure it will be running for at least 1 week after your submission, f your server if free. f not, then please  indicate in the email that the server is off.  Our engineer will contact you to switch on the server.
    - Implemented APIs: indicate which APIs are implemented 
    - Attach your ROS node, named `<first_name>_<last_name>.py` (if implemented in python)

> **Useful Hacks:** 
> * **Linux within Windows**: If you suffer from slow performance of virtual machine, or you don't want to run dual boot system (as you keep going back and forth), you may try Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), you can run linux commands within Windows OS, much faster than in virtual machine. [Here is a short tutorial to get started with WSL.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about)
> * **Text editor**: you may use 'gedit' to edit files, which is a friendly user interface, but you need a graphical interface running, something that is not always affordable (say you are ssh a remote server). For power users, there is a better alternative that boosts your productivity ten folds beyond any graphical tool. Try vim, a text editor that comes with a learning curve. But it will pay off. [Here is a short tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggSyF1SVFr4).
> * **Terminal multiplexer** : Suppose you log in to your remote cloud server with your laptop and run a command on the server. Then, suppose you lose internet connection, or the battery dies, or say you decide to switch off the laptop and continue working from home. What happens is that once you lose your ssh connection, your terminal dies with it, and all running processes forked from the terminal will get terminated. Therefore, you need some approach to keep commands running in the background, even if you get disconnected, and then attach to the left terminals. The solution is [terminal multiplixer](https://linuxize.com/post/getting-started-with-tmux/), an interesting software that allows you to resolve the disconnection issue plus more. You can even split your terminal into multiple zones, saving you from opening several terminals. [Here is a video tutorial.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yl7NFenTgIo) Run ```sudo apt install tmux``` and try it.
> * **Tiling Window Manager**: Linux has a flexible architecture, allowing users to customize practically everything. An important part of any operating system distribution is [window manager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Window_manager), a piece of software that organizes window placements. The default window manager for Ubuntu is [Gnome](https://release.gnome.org/) (as of 2022). You may customize it as you wish. I personally recommend a different kind of window manager, called tiling window manager. This class of window managers automatically controls window placements into tiles, with minimal user involvement, clicks, and muscle movements. Once you get used to shortcuts, your productivity improves another ten fold (after using vim). [Try i3 window manager](https://i3wm.org/)! Here is a [video tutorial to get started](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1I63wGcvU4).
> * **A more friendly shell**: Shell is a kind of user interface that is based on text only, with no graphics. The default ubuntu shell is called Bash. Similar to graphical interface (e.g., ubuntu, fedoraI), it is a matter of personal taste. personally like ```fish```, or a friendly interactive shell. It comes with a nice auto-complete and a dozen shortcuts (similar to that of ```ipython``` if you used it). [Here is a short tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2a7jJTh3kU). **Warning**: you cannot run all standard bash commands out of the box. For example, you can't load (or source) bash configuration files. To source any bash config (such as ROS environment setup), you need a fish plugin called ```bass```.[ Clone the GitHub repo and test it yourself](https://github.com/edc/bass).
