> **Useful Hacks:** 
> * **Linux within Windows**: If you suffer from slow performance of virtual machine, or you don't want to run dual boot system (as you keep going back and forth), you may try Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), you can run linux commands within Windows OS, much faster than in virtual machine. [Here is a short tutorial to get started with WSL.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about)
> * **Text editor**: you may use 'gedit' to edit files, which is a friendly user interface, but you need a graphical interface running, something that is not always affordable (say you are ssh a remote server). For power users, there is a better alternative that boosts your productivity ten folds beyond any graphical tool. Try vim, a text editor that comes with a learning curve. But it will pay off. [Here is a short tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggSyF1SVFr4).
> * **Terminal multiplexer** : Suppose you log in to your remote cloud server with your laptop and run a command on the server. Then, suppose you lose internet connection, or the battery dies, or perhaps you decide to switch off the laptop and continue working from home. What happens is that once you lose your ssh connection, your terminal dies with it, and all running processes forked from the terminal will get terminated. Therefore, you need some approach to keep commands running in the background, even if you get disconnected. The solution is [terminal multiplixer](https://linuxize.com/post/getting-started-with-tmux/). [Here is a video tutorial.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yl7NFenTgIo)
> * **Tiling Window Manager**: Linux has a flexible architecture, allowing users to customize practically everything. An important part of any operating system distribution is [window manager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Window_manager), a piece of software that organizes window placements. The default window manager for Ubuntu is [Gnome](https://release.gnome.org/) (as of 2022). You may customize it as you wish. I personally recommend a different kind of window manager, called tiling window manager. This class of window managers automatically controls window placements into tiles, with minimal user involvement, clicks, and muscle movements. Once you get used to shortcuts, your productivity improves another ten times (after using vim). [Try i3 window manager](https://i3wm.org/)! Here is a [video tutorial to get started](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1I63wGcvU4).
