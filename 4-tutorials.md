## [Robotic System Integration | Summer Course 2022](https://avlab.io/robotic-sys-integration-course/)
_Designed and delivered by Eyad Shakab, Arjun Sharma, and Dr. Majid Khonji_ 
[July 13 - July 22]

This high-level course teaches the basics of system integration using Linux OS and Robot Operating System (ROS). The objective is to build technical maturity and problem-solving skills to deal with diverse software efficiently and in a timely manner to get the task done. The course targets audiences from computer science (CS) backgrounds as well as those from other engineering disciplines as long as they are curious to learn beyond the instructions provided. For CS majors, the course will be more like a revision of basics but at the same time integrates different approaches that the student might not have been exposed to together.
