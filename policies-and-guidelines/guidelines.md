# Task Management in MS Planner

Ensuring a systematic approach to task assignment and tracking is vital for team productivity. Using MS Planner helps us maintain transparency, hold team members accountable, and ensure that projects stay on course. The guidelines below will aid in organizing and prioritizing our work seamlessly.

- **Bucket Creation**: Create a personal bucket for tasks where you are the primary contact.
- **Task Duration**:
  - Development Tasks: 1-2 weeks. If longer, split the task. If shorter, include it as a bullet point within a larger task.
  - Research Tasks: 2-4 weeks.
- **Task Details**: Title should be self-explanatory. If not, add details in notes or a checklist.
- **Modifications**: Don't alter task dates or delete tasks without logging the change in comments.
- **Task Status**:
  - **Inactive Tasks**:
    - **[Deleted]**: Log reason in comments.
    - **[Missed]**: Rename to "[Missed] original title" and mark complete.
    - **[Cancelled]**: Rename to "[Cancelled] original title", mark complete, and comment the reason.
  - **Active Tasks**:
    - **[Pending X]**: Highlight dependencies (e.g., "Vendor Approval").
    - **[Continuous]**: For ongoing tasks without a set end date.
    - **[Behind-the-Moon]**: For tasks without a specific deadline.
- **Task Status Order**:
  1. Status-less tasks.
  2. Pending X.
  3. Continuous.
  4. Behind-the-Moon.
- **App Recommendation**: Consider installing the Planner app on your phone.

# Teams Communication

Clear and efficient communication forms the cornerstone of effective teamwork. By standardizing our communication practices on Microsoft Teams, we can reduce misunderstandings, ensure timely responses, and create an organized communication flow. The following guidelines set the groundwork for these streamlined interactions.

- **Thread Responses**: Reply within relevant threads. Avoid starting similar new ones.
- **Notifications**: 
  - Use "@" to notify specific individuals or groups:
    - @KUCARS Autonomous Vehicle Lab: Notifies all lab members.
    - @Team: Targets students, engineers, and postdocs.
    - @Students: All students (PhD and MSc).
    - @Engineers: Engineers and visiting engineers.
    - @Postdocs: Postdocs and PhD visitors.
- **Channels**:
  - **General**: Broad topics related to R&D.
  - **1- Research [Perception and Prediction]**: Machine perception & prediction research.
  - **2- Research [Planning and Reasoning]**: Software/hardware development.
  - **3- Development [System and Platform Integration]**: Software/hardware development.
  - **4- Operation [SAN AV Test Facility]**: Operational discussions about the SAN campus test facility.
  - **Random**: Casual chat, jokes, memes.

# Overleaf Naming Conventions

With the vast number of collaborative documents we produce on Overleaf, a uniform naming convention becomes essential. It not only simplifies document retrieval but also prevents potential mix-ups, ensuring that team members can quickly locate and collaborate on any document.

- **Conferences**: "[<Conference Shortname Year>] <paper title>" 
  - Example: [ICRA 2024] Constrained Multi-agent POMDP.
- **Journals**: Use the journal name in place of the conference name.
- **Technical Reports**: Replace conference name with [Tech Report].
- **Thesis and Proposals**:
  - PhD: [PhD Thesis <student first name>].
  - MSc: [MSc Thesis <student first name>].
  - Proposal: [PhD Proposal <student first name>].

# Publication Protocols

Our publications stand as a testament to our research's quality and dedication. By following a consistent protocol for publications, we acknowledge our sponsors appropriately, clarify authorship, and uphold the integrity of our work in the academic community.

- Include grant numbers: CIRA-2020-286 and KUCARS. Check for latest codes if needed.
- Discuss author order with your advisor.
- Order authors based on contribution.
- Include all co-advisors.
