The AV Lab autonomous vehicle fleet is composed of two last-mile passenger vehicles and a Nissan Leaf retrofitted vehicle. The vehicles are equipped with LiDAR sensors and multiple cameras. We are eager to share our platform with researchers in this field. Please contact our research engineer Eyad Shaklab to initiate research collaboration.
