# Last Mile Passenger Mobility & Data Collection
The AV Lab has a fleet of autonomous vehicles, consisting of two passenger vehicles for last-mile transportation and a retrofitted Nissan Leaf. These vehicles are equipped with LiDAR sensors and multiple cameras, allowing for advanced sensing and perception capabilities. We are excited to collaborate with researchers in this field and welcome any inquiries about research partnerships. Please feel free to reach out to us to explore opportunities for collaboration.

# Other Research Platforms
Our lab also develops and operates additional research platforms, including a retrofitted Nissan Leaf electric vehicle equipped for autonomous driving experiments and a digital twin of the SAN Campus for simulation and testing. These platforms support advanced research in perception, planning, and system integration for smart mobility solutions.
