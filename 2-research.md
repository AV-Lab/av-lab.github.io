## AV Perception and Situation Awareness
This line of research is dedicated to refining perception and situational awareness capabilities within the field of autonomous vehicles. Upcoming efforts will place emphasis on formulating robust perception systems able to capture and report model uncertainties. Current projects span from detecting and tracking multiple objects, predicting vehicle wheel slip in off-road conditions, to semantic segmentation of underexposed images.
