# Work Environment and Collaboration

- **Physical Presence**: All students and staff are expected to be present at the AV Lab or designated locations during KU's official working hours. This presence should align with the productivity needs and safety protocols defined by the Advisor.
  
- **Collaboration with Peers**: Active collaboration is crucial within the AV Lab team. Sharing insights, assisting peers, and driving the project's goals forward should be a collective endeavor.

# Technical Expectations

- **Advisor's Requests**: Students and staff are obligated to fulfill technical, academic, and administrative requests from the Advisor. This encompasses a range of requirements from software submissions to scientific writing and other relevant materials.

- **Response Time**: When the Advisor requests materials or information, the expected response time is within 24 hours. If a particular request demands more time due to its complexity or unavailability, it is essential to communicate this to the Advisor immediately. Extensions will be granted based on the specific circumstances.

# Task and Documentation Management

To ensure our research and collaborative efforts are efficient and transparent, timely updating of various documentation is essential:

- **Vacation Schedule**: On the "General" channel, there's a dedicated "Vacation Schedule" tab. Ensure it is updated well in advance, allowing the team to plan accordingly.
  
- **Publications Tracking**: Promptly update the "Publications" document whenever a paper is submitted, reviewed, or accepted.
  
- **Source Code Management**:
    - Everyone should utilize Github for code versioning and collaboration.
    - All source code IP belongs to Khalifa University and should primarily be posted in the AV Lab's official repository.
    - Before posting code on personal Github accounts, secure approval. This ensures that all intellectual property is protected and aligned with the university's standards.
  
- **Accessing Key Links**: The "General" channel on Teams houses tabs with all major links crucial for our projects and collaborations. Always check there first if you're searching for a key link or resource.

By maintaining up-to-date documentation and following the proper channels for code submission, we ensure the integrity, efficiency, and transparency of our collective efforts.

# Task Management in MS Planner

Efficient task management is crucial for a productive team. MS Planner serves as a tool to ensure transparency, accountability, and project progression. The following guidelines aim to streamline our task management process:

- **Bucket Creation**: Always create a personal bucket for tasks that designate you as the primary point of contact.
  
- **Task Duration**: 
  - Development Tasks: Generally range from 1-2 weeks. Segment longer tasks. If a task is brief, integrate it within a broader task.
  - Research Tasks: Typically span 2-4 weeks.
  
- **Task Details**: A task title should be intuitive. If clarity is required, expand in notes or use a checklist.
  
- **Modifications**: Changing task dates or deletions should be tracked with a comment for record purposes.
  
- **Task Status**: 
  - **Inactive Tasks**:
    - **[Deleted]**: Document reasons in comments.
    - **[Missed]**: Adjust title to "[Missed] original title" and mark as completed.
    - **[Cancelled]**: Adjust title to "[Cancelled] original title", complete the task, and provide the cancellation rationale.
  
  - **Active Tasks**:
    - **[Pending X]**: Emphasize dependencies (e.g., "Vendor Approval").
    - **[Continuous]**: For perpetual tasks with no specified end date.
    - **[Behind-the-Moon]**: For tasks with an open-ended timeline.
  
- **Task Status Order**: 
  1. Tasks without a status.
  2. Pending X.
  3. Continuous.
  4. Behind-the-Moon.
  
- **App Recommendation**: For convenience, consider the Planner mobile app.

# MS Teams Communication

Effective communication is foundational to teamwork. By adopting a structured approach on Microsoft Teams, we aim to minimize miscommunications, ensure prompt replies, and establish an orderly flow of discussions:

- **Thread Responses**: Engage within existing threads. Refrain from initiating redundant conversations.
  
- **Notifications**: Use "@" to direct messages:
    - @KUCARS Autonomous Vehicle Lab: For all lab members.
    - @Team: For students, engineers, and postdocs.
    - @Students: Specifically for PhD and MSc students.
    - @Engineers: For the engineering team.
    - @Postdocs: For postdoc members.
  
- **Channels**:
  - **General**: Discussions encompassing R&D.
  - **1- Research [Perception and Prediction]**: Delve into machine perception & prediction research.
  - **2- Research [Planning and Reasoning]**: Pertains to software/hardware development.
  - **3- Development [System and Platform Integration]**: Focus on software/hardware integrations.
  - **4- Operation [SAN AV Test Facility]**: Dialogues about the SAN campus test initiatives.
  - **Random**: A space for light-hearted conversations and memes.

# Overleaf Naming Conventions

Given the multitude of collaborative documents on Overleaf, adopting a consistent naming convention is paramount. This will aid in swift document retrieval and reduce overlaps:

- **Conferences**: `[<Conference Acronym Year>] <paper title>` 
    - Example: `[ICRA 2024] Constrained Multi-agent POMDP`.
  
- **Journals**: Replace the conference name with the journal's name.
  
- **Technical Reports**: Use [Tech Report] instead of the conference acronym.
  
- **Thesis and Proposals**:
    - PhD: `[PhD Thesis <student's first name>]`.
    - MSc: `[MSc Thesis <student's first name>]`.
    - Proposal: `[PhD Proposal <student's first name>]`.

# Publication Protocols

Publications reflect the caliber and rigor of our research. By adhering to a coherent publication protocol, we ensure the correct acknowledgment of our sponsors, clarify authorship arrangements, and maintain academic integrity:

- Ensure the inclusion of grant numbers: CIRA-2020-286 and KUCARS. Update as required.
  
- Engage with your advisor to determine the author sequence.
    - The sequence should reflect the magnitude of contributions.
    - Ensure all co-advisors are included. If omitted, it implies the advisory committee needs revisiting.


# Lab Behavior and Etiquette

Maintaining a quiet and respectful environment within the AV Lab is essential for fostering concentration, productivity, and a harmonious work atmosphere. By adhering to the guidelines below, we can ensure that all members feel comfortable, valued, and respected:

- **Noise Levels**: Please maintain a low volume when discussing or collaborating with colleagues. Consider stepping out or using a meeting room for prolonged or louder discussions.

- **Mobile Phones**: Set phones to silent or vibrate mode while in the lab. If you need to take a call, kindly step outside or move to a designated area.

- **Headphones**: Use headphones when listening to music or watching videos. Ensure the volume isn't too loud to disturb others or prevent you from hearing any alarms or announcements.

- **Cleanliness**: Clean up after yourself. Ensure workspaces are tidy and free from clutter. If you use shared equipment or common areas, return them to their original state for the next person.

- **Respect Personal Space**: Refrain from touching or using someone's belongings without permission. Always ask before borrowing tools, equipment, or materials.

- **Feedback and Concerns**: Open communication is encouraged. If someone's behavior is disturbing you, approach them politely, and express your concerns. If needed, discuss issues with the Advisor or designated person.

- **Inclusivity**: Promote an inclusive environment. Be mindful of diverse backgrounds and respect everyone's opinions and values.

By committing to these guidelines, we can create an optimal working environment that fosters collaboration while respecting every individual's need for concentration and respect.
